|   This mod aims to make Anna's good ending actually, well, good for her.  |
|   I know this concept has been tried before, but I decided to try my hand |
|   at it regardless. With my own story.                                    |
|                                                                           |
|   I don't think I am the only one who felt like the vanilla "good" ending |
|   in Anna's storyline wasn't exactly "good" for anyone involved.          |
|   For the matter of fact, I don't think I can name one thing about it     |
|   which is better than the vanilla "bad" one really.                      |
|   But I digress.                                                          |
|                                                                           |
|   Now, through the power of certain story plotholes, which may or may not |
|   make sense, you have an opportunity to actually save Anna.              |
|   You can even get a happily (debatable) ever after and some cuddles. :P  |
|   Nothing explicit/NSFW though.                                           |
|                                                                           |

|   - Sleep with Anna. Well, that's the only way for the game to know you   |
|   actually "Romanced" her.                                                |
|   - Meet with Adine 3 times. It's actually important for this mod's story.|
|   She should also be on "impressed" terms with you.                       |
|   - Adine should obviously be alive to play her part.                     |
|   - Saving some other characters and/or having Remy's good ending might   |
|   also affect certain scenes. Having true ending finished will also add   |
|   more scenes.                                                            |
