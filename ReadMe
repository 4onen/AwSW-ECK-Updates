|                                                                           |
|   Following my previous idea of making a an actually good ending for the  |
|   characters, here's my take on Bryce's story or, rather, its conclusion. |
|   It started off pretty small but over time somehow it has developed into |
|   a huge ambitious project.                                               |
|                                                                           |
|   Bryce's story had left a rather odd aftertaste for me when I'd finished |
|   it for two main reasons. First, everyone will still die which basically |
|   makes it a bad ending in disguise. Second, he took you shooting Maverick|
|   surprisingly lightly considering their long-term friendship.            |
|                                                                           |
|   This mod aims to adress both of these larger issues and add plenty of   |
|   flavor of its own. It's also an experiment to try and make different    |
|   mods interact with each other without crashing the game.                |
|                                                                           |
|   And just like "Not-so-Tragic Hero", this one is named after the opposite|
|   of what corresponding ending achievement ("Murderer") is called, as in  |
|   simply "Savior". I mean, you DO get to save the Dragonland afterall.    |
|                                                                           |

|   - Have seen Adine's good ending.                                        |
|   - Have seen Bryce's default good ending.                                |
|   - Get the underground complex map and give it to Maverick before going  |
|   to Reza's booby-trapped hideout.                                        |
|   - Save Sebastian from being murdered by Izumi/Reza.                     |
|   - Going to Anna's 3rd date will open up a new scene in one of the mod's |
|   story arcs.                                                             |
|   - Playing "Not-so-Tragic Hero" in advance isn't really required,        |
|   however, it will open up a huge branching extra storyline for you to    |
|   explore. Maybe a bit too huge.                                          |
|   However, since I wasn't smart enough to include persistent values in the|
|   original release of "Not-so-Tragic Hero", to avoid making you play      |
|   through everything again, I've released an update for it.               |
|   All you need to do is to load up a save file from the mod and get to    |
|   the nearest ending where Anna survives (no matter if it's good or bad). |
